Employ management system using C++ is a menu-driven program that allows us to add, update, delete and search records of an employee working in an organization.

Employee Management system using C++ program uses EmpID as unique identifier (i.e. primary key) to recognize employee. So, we canâ€™t add two employees having same ID. After successful entry of records of some employee, we can search record on the basic of ID or department. We can search particular employee from ID choosing option #2 and if we want to see all employee working in a department, we have to choose another option (i.e. option#3 in menu). We can list all employee records also using option #4 in menu. Again, we can update and delete existing record. Thus, this project is useful to mange employee records in an organization.
